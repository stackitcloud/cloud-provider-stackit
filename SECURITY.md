# Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

We at STACKIT take security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please email [cybersecurity@stackit.cloud](mailto:cybersecurity@stackit.cloud).

Our team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.
